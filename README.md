Do in future: <br/>
  1)What if a user makes an inappropriate choice like 'dog'? How can we extend the function to handle that?;<br/>
  2)What if players in the game could also choose Rope in this game?;<br/>
  3)In this version, if both players make the same choice, the game returns a tie.
    What if the game didn't end there but instead asked both players for new choices?;<br/>
